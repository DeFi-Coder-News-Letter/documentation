## Method B : Sign in via DApp

DApp is an abbreviated form for Decentralized Application. They work just like an App from the App Store, but on the decentralised system.

### Step 1 : Visit a DApp and look out for Torus logo

It will be shown either as "TORUS" or a "T"

Note: This experience is only available for DApps that have integrated Torus. 

Users can try it on the following **shortlisted DApps** that better illustrate the seamless login experience.

* [gDAI - Gasless DAI](https://gdai.io/)
* [1inchexchange - Aggregated Token Swap](https://1inch.exchange/#/)
