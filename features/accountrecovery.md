# Account Recovery

Torus's OAuth logins inherits account recovery and management mechanisms from thier Verifiers. For example; Google's own password recovery system, or Facebook's method of questions such as your birthday, mothers maiden name etc... In this manner, your Users would be able to recover their Torus wallet through recovering thier specific social account, with UX flows that they are already used to having.

Each OAuth provider has their own methods of handling account recovery, completely independent from Torus.
