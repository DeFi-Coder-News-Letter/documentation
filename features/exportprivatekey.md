# Export Private Key

Users are able to use the respective OAuth recovery method to maintain access to their account in the event that they lose their password or when their password or 2FA device is compromised.

In the event where the user would like to export their private key and use their funds from a different wallet provider, they can export their private key from `Settings > Private Key`.
