# DirectAuth Integration

Applications can directly interact with the Torus Network to assign, store and retrieve keys on the network - Distributed Key Generation as a Service. The integration is compatible with both web/native apps, applications get access to the OAuth scopes provided to them \(name/email from Google\) and there are no longer pop-ups - applications literally own the UX.

## What does this mean for my application?

Using DirectAuth allows you to manage an app-specific private key for your users, while storing it in the distributed Torus Network. It allows you to control the user experience and interface for all user interactions, without having to rely on the Torus Wallet interface for user confirmations via popups.
